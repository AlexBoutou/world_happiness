### Description
The objective is to observe the countries of the world in which the populations consider themselves the happiest; and see what are the "criteria of happiness" according to the regions of the world. We therefore want to visualize on a world map the level of happiness of the inhabitants of different countries, and the factors which, according to them, most influence their happiness.

</br>

### Some questions we want to answer

- What is the evolution of inhabitants' happiness of 150 diffferent countries over 5 years.
- Which are the countries where people are the happiest ?
- Are there any correlations between some factors of happiness and the regions of the world ?

</br>

### Data

We collected our data from a dataset available on Kaggle, just here -> https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness
This is a gathering of the results of the Gallup report on happiness from 2015 to 2019.

</br>
